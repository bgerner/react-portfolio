        <p>
          My name is Benjamin (Ben) Gerner. I love skiing and climbing which is
          a big reason that I'm going to Boulder for school next year. I'm an
          NASM certified personal trainer and have gained a lot of experience in
          the fitness field through personal experience with different types of
          exercise including crossfit, powerlifting, bodybuilding, and
          sport-specific training. I have had cartilage damage in my right knee
          for about 4 years now, and have learned a lot about knee injuries and
          the recovery/ build up process through physical therapy and my own
          research. I am also adept at working with hurt shoulders, as I have
          had injuries to my biceps tendon and rotator cuff resulting from
          overuse with lifting, football, and water polo. I offer fully
          customized programs for any imaginable fitness goal. Furthermore, I
          have experience with several mental health/ fitness techniques
          including the Wim Hof Method and Tai Chi. Everything that a person
          does and every decision that they make stems from their mentality, and
          improving mental fitness is my number one goal with each one of my
          clients. Please see the contact form below if you want me to help you
          change your life for the better!
